# XOR_and_Recurrent_attention_model

### Task 1: XOR net

Create a RNN network which can correctly compute the XOR operation.

### Task 2: RAM net

In this task, you are going to implement part of the recurrent attention model (RAM) shown in this paper ["Recurrent Models of Visual Attention"](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5542-recurrent-models-of-visual-attention.pdf).
